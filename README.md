# Install instructions

    cd /opt
    sudo git clone https://github.com/obsolescence/pidp1.git
    /opt/pidp1/install/install.sh

Note that you do not necessarily need to have the PiDP-1 hardware. 

This will run on any Pi. **Without** PiDP-1 front panel hardware, you can use the on-screen virtual front panel.
With the virtual front panel, this will ALSO run fine on regular Linux (tested on Ubuntu 24.10) and presumably, Windows 11 with WSL2 subsystem (although untested). Just in case you want to have a mobile PDP-1 to develop on the go.
