Ironic Computer Space Simulator for the PDP-1
vers. 1.2, Norbert Landsteiner Nov 13 2016


Requires a DEC PDP-1 with the automatic multiply/divide option (mul/div).

Source format: Unix new lines, tabs set to 8 spaces (like browsers, etc).


The program is in the public domain as long as the name of the author (me)
and the date of the program (2016, not 1962) are preserved.


Start address 4: control boxes (iot 11)
Start address 5: testword controls (lat)


Sense Switch Options

SSW 1 ...  Parallax effect
             off - Stars roll continuously to the left.
             on  - Background stars move relatively to rocket ship.
SSW 2 ...  Parallax Effect Etrength (together with SSW 1)
             off - Subtle effect.
             on  - Stronger effect.
SSW 3 ...  Torpedo Agility (steering)
             off - Normal.
             on  - Agile.
SSW 4 ...  Saucer Motion
             off - Diagonals are horizontally stretched.
                   (conforms more to the overall impression of CS)
             on  - Geometrical diagonals.
SSW 5 ...  Saucer Piloting, which saucer is shooting?
             off - Always the same one (as in original CS).
             on  - Random select.
SSW 6 ...  Scoring Mode
             off - Original: single digit, truncated with wrap-around,
                   player in hex (wraps at 16), saucer decimal (wraps at 10).
             on  - No wrap-around, both scores display as a single hex digit,
                   each extra play has to be won separately in order to continue.


Note on scoring and extra play:

By default, the scoring mechanism of the original arcade machine is simulated,
where the player's score is truncated to a single hexadecimal digit (wrapping
at 16) and the saucers' score is truncated to a decimal single-digit value
(wrapping at 10). Since, with this method, the actual score values are truncated
and wrapped, the player wins even on a wrap-around. Scores are preserved for the
extra play ('Hyperspace Mode') and the game continues with accumulating scores.

With sense switch 6 active, the scores are maintained internally and truncated
to a single-digit hexadecimal figure for the display only. Since the full values
are maintained internally, any visual wrapping doesn't account for the decision
on the winner. While scores are preserved, as above, each extra play has to be
won separately in order to continue. (This is to prevent the player from
accumulating a substantial lead for a nearly unlimited number of consecutive
extra plays. Thus, every game remains a challenge.)
