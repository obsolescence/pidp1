Source code and binary (octal) here: https://masswerk.at/spacewar/sources/minskytron_ii.zip

The unfinished and unlisted blog post is here (which also allows to play with the Minskytron, including the "Minskytron II" extensions for changing the operator inside the oscillators, which are mapped to the sense switches in the extended PDP-1 version): https://masswerk.at/nowgobang/2023/minskytron

The playground can be found here (direct link): https://masswerk.at/nowgobang/2023/minskytron#playground
