# Description

This is a combination of p7sim and tapevis.
It simulates a type 30 display, and visually shows
paper tape reader and punch.

# Features

It should behave just like p7sim and tapevis.
Admittedly this behaviour should be better documented :)

# Usage

Press 'F11' to switch between windows and fullscreen mode.

Press 'L' to go into layout mode, here you can rearrange
the three regions, left mouse button moves, right button resizes.
Cycling with tab and using the arrow keys also works.
Use ctrl to resize and shift for more precise movement.

Create a new layout with '=' and cycle through layouts with space.

Save the current configuration with 'S' and re-read it with 'R'.

The background can currently only be set by editing the configuration,
`pdp1_layout.txt` in the current directory.
